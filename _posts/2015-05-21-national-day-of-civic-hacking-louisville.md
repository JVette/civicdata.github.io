Hack for Change Louisville was held as the city’s official [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) event, one of over 100 simultaneous events across the United States. The day brought together local government leaders and staff, local organizations, non-profits, businesses, visitors, and community members and was focused on civic innovation.

[Louisville’s Code for America brigade](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/Civic-Data-Alliance/), the [Civic Data Alliance](http://www.civicdataalliance.org/), volunteered to organize this year’s event and partnered with [Code Louisville](http://www.codelouisville.org/) for event hosting and promotions.
