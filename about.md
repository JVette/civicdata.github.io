The Civic Data Alliance (CDA) is Louisville's [Code for America Brigade](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/index/Civic_Data_Alliance), and we are focused on being a force for open data, hosting hackathons, coding education, and civic engagement.

**Making Public Data Truly Public**

*We are the public's voice for open data, interested in liberating, improving, gathering, defining, and reporting on public data.*

**History and Leadership**

Louisville's Code for America Brigade was founded in January of 2013 by Michael Schnuerle.

On September 2013, the Civic Data Alliance was created by [Patrick Smith](http://citycollaborative.org/), [Bret Walker](http://www.louiewatch.com/), [Chris Harrell](http://www.lazarusllc.com/) and [Michael Schnuerle](http://www.yourmapper.com/) to be a voice for citizens.  

The CDA was officially merged with the Louisville Brigade in May 2014 when it became a Level 2 brigade.

As of October 2014, over 100 people and volunteers have participated in our hackathons, meetups, and events.  Thank you!

**Code of Conduct**

All members, volunteers, and event participants agree to abide by [The Code for America Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct)
