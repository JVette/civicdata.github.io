**History and Leadership**

Louisville's Code for America Brigade was founded in December of 2012 by Michael Schnuerle after partnering with Louisville Metro since 2011 to open crime, restaurant, and permit data, creating interactive maps for the city, and advising on the city's open data portal launch in October 2011.

On September 2013, the Civic Data Alliance was created by [Patrick Smith](http://citycollaborative.org/), [Bret Walker](http://www.louiewatch.com/), [Chris Harrell](http://www.lazarusllc.com/) and [Michael Schnuerle](http://www.yourmapper.com/) to be a voice for citizens.  

The CDA was merged with the Louisville Brigade in May 2014 when it became a Member CfA Brigade.

In December 2014 we reached official Brigade status with Code for America.

As of June 2015, over 300 people and volunteers have participated in our hackathons, meetups, and events.  Thank you!

We've had **14 meetups**, run **7 hackathons**, worked on **29 civic public projects**, and donated over **6,000 hours** of volunteer time to the community!

**Code of Conduct**

All members, volunteers, and event participants agree to abide by [The Code for America Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct)
