The Civic Data Alliance (CDA) is Louisville's [Code for America Brigade](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/index/Civic_Data_Alliance), and we are focused on being a force for open data, hosting hackathons, coding education, and civic engagement.

**Making Public Data Truly Public**

*We are the public's voice for open data, interested in liberating, improving, gathering, defining, and reporting on public data.*
